## Verb Study _tactics_

### Case rotations

- master the _indicitive case_
- master the _presumptive case_
- master the _imperative case_
- master the _progressive case_
- master the _potential case_
- master the _conditional case_

- mastering these cases will be no easy feat and will takes months of diligent study.
- make a circular / rotational diagram of these cases
- rotate through the cases as you make example sentances
- you can rotate through once a week or every few days etc
  - week 1 conditional (positive, negative, polite, plain)
  - week 2 potential (positive, negative, polite, plain)
  - ...

### learn one new common verb completely

- master an individual verb
- pick from a list of essential verbs
- master _all_ the cases for one verb
- e.g.
  - day 1: 泳ぐ -> all cases
  - day 2: 食べる -> all cases

### vary verbs based on endings

- there is a finite state space of 10 different endings to inflect on (ichidan ru + 9 u verbs)
- select 10 verbs to match these categories
- slowly go through each word and conjugate them all fully with example sentances
- e.g.
  - week 1: 食べる
    - 食べる、食べない、食べます、食べません
    - 食べた、食べなっかた、食べました, 食べませんでした

### stop and consider patterns

- there are 48 inflections across the different 'moods' tenses and politeness levels
- however there are certain patterns that are followed
- consult third party sources and organise the information into something easily parsable
  - e.g. 
    - 食べる、食べられる
    - 食べない、食べられない
    - 食べます、食べられます
